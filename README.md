# expressApi
A small backend application for a project in my Masters Electrical and Computer Engineering course where I needed to develop and implement a server application 
for a fitness web and smarphone application. The server application was developed in NodeJS using Express framework and Javascript.
This repository doesn't show the last version of the server application.
